# Database Server

> The project lab hosts a database server with MySQL and [Microsoft SQL](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866662) server installed and for use with in-class projects like internal assessments.

For now, this server can be accessed locally from any of the IT labs, however there are future plans for the server to be made remotely available.

To gain access, speak to a computer science teacher and a set of personal credentials can be created for you.
